# Weather Data Web Application

## Project Overview

This project is a web application that fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. The application provides real-time weather information, including current conditions and temperature, in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Location Detection**: Automatically fetches weather data based on the user's geographical location.
- **Manual Location Input**: Users can enter any location to retrieve weather information for that area.

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be visually appealing and functional on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page and displaying weather information.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching data from the weather API and handling user interactions.

## Getting Started

To view the project, you can use: https://mosisafeyissa.github.io/PRODIGY_WD_05/ . You may need to sign up for a weather API key and update the script to include your API key for data fetching.

### Note

For the best experience, it is recommended to work locally by downloading the project files. Some features may not function correctly when run directly from the web due to browser restrictions on API calls.
